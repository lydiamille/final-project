Final Project for INFO 230: Introduction to Programming

This program will write a soprano line based on user input, following baroque part-writing rules.
Input consists of a text file called song1.txt (or song2.txt, etc)
The file has blanks where the user can enter a key, bassline, chords, and a starting soprano note
The program, when called with song1.txt as the cli arg, will write a soprano line that fits nicely with the information given.
